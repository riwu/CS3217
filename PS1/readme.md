Problem Set 1
=============

1. Clone this repository to begin working.
2. Do not modify the `AppDelegate.swift`, `LaunchScreen.xib`, `Main.storyboard`, `Images.xcassets` files (you do not have to).
3. Write your answers to non-coding questions in `answers.txt`.
4. Take a look at `.gitignore`. It contains rules that ignores the changes in certain files when committing an Xcode project to revision control.

Have fun!
