Question:
Dictionary keys must conform to the Hashable protocol. Why is this necessary?

Answer:
The keys must be mapped to an index in the hash table in order to store the values. 
Hence to ensure that the key type has a "hashValue" property 
(which fulfills the criteria that variableA == variableB -> variableA.hashValue = variableB.hashValue), 
it must be a requirement for keys to conform to the Hashable protocol, 
ensuring that key types without "hashValue" implemented will cause a compile-time error. 
Without this requirement, keys without .hashValue property will cause a run-time error instead, 
which is clearly less desirable than a compile-time error.
